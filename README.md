# Simon Game

## Description 
A game where the skill depends on your memory! Simon picks a color and you have to match it, simon will increase the amount of colors you have to match until Simon runs out of colors pr you pick wrong!

## Installation 
just follow [this]() link to the game!

## Issues 
The game in its current state unfortunately does not work correctly it is yet to be deployed as i have a few bugs to iron out namely a way for the simon to iterate through colors before the player can copy its movements
